I am a doctoral student at the [Autonomous Systems Lab](http://www.asl.ethz.ch/) at [ETH Zurich](https://www.ethz.ch/en.html), Switzerland. I work under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Roland Siegwart](http://www.asl.ethz.ch/the-lab/people/person-detail.Mjk5ODE=.TGlzdC8yMDI4LDEyMDExMzk5Mjg=.html), Dr. Juan Nieto and [Dr. Cesar Cadena Lerma](http://www.asl.ethz.ch/the-lab/people/person-detail.html?persid=223714). My PhD work is a joint collaboration with [Disney Research](https://www.disneyresearch.com/) at Zurich where I worked with Dr. Paul Beardsley.

My thesis focusses on generating accurate 3D reconstructions of natural structures and environments, like trees and corals, from data captured using robots. I develop algorithms that make use of both colour and depth information from images and try to reconstruct the underlying 3D structure of the object. 

I use various techniques from Computer Vision, Computer Graphics, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Robotics in my research. For a quick overview check out some of my [projects](projects) and [publications](publications).
