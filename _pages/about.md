I am a postdoctoral research associate at the Sydney Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Systems (SIRIS) at The University of Sydney, Australia.

I work at the junction of Computer Vision, Robotics and Computer Graphics to develop algorithms that enable robots to understand what they see and to generate reconstructions of their environments with high accuracy. The primary environments of focus in my research are natural environments, both terrestrial (with trees and vegetation) and underwater (with corals).

For a quick overview, check out some of my [projects](projects) and [publications](publications).

Formerly, I was a doctoral student at the [Autonomous Systems Lab](http://www.asl.ethz.ch/) at [ETH Zurich](https://www.ethz.ch/en.html), Switzerland. 
The advisors of my doctoral thesis were [Prof. Dr. Roland Siegwart](http://www.asl.ethz.ch/the-lab/people/person-detail.Mjk5ODE=.TGlzdC8yMDI4LDEyMDExMzk5Mjg=.html) and [Dr. Paul Beardsley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/p-beardsley/).
I was co-supervised by Dr. Juan Nieto and [Dr. Cesar Cadena Lerma](http://www.asl.ethz.ch/the-lab/people/person-detail.html?persid=223714). 
My thesis was on semantic segmentation and mapping in natural environments and was a joint collaboration with [Disney Research](https://www.disneyresearch.com/) at Zurich.

Prior to that I obtained a Master of Science degree in Robotics, Systems and Control at [ETH Zurich](https://www.ethz.ch/en.html) and a Bachelor of Technology degree in Electrical Engineering at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Jodhpur](http://iitj.ac.in/).
