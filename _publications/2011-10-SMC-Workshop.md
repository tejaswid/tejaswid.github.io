## Abstract
Human activity recognition can be used to devise assistants
that provide proactive support by exploiting the knowledge of
the user’s context, determined from sensors located on-body.
By using on body sensors, typically integrated into clothing
or found in mobile gadgets, the system can operate at any
time, regardless of the user’s location. Activity recognition
is an enabling technology that can lead to great societal
beneﬁts. There are a wide range of domains which can beneﬁt
from it, as evidenced in the wearable, mobile and pervasive
computing communities: health care (in particular elderly
assistance), industrial worker assistance, sports, entertainment,
human-computer interfaces, human-robot interaction, etc. The
design and development of activity recognition systems pose
important challenges to the machine learning community. They
typically involve high-dimensional, multimodal streams of data
characterized by a large variability, where data portions may
be missing or labels can be unreliable. Notwithstanding the
large amount of research endeavors aimed at tackling these
issues, the comparison of different approaches is often not
possible due to the lack of common benchmarking tools and
datasets that allow for replicable and fair testing procedures
across several research groups. The aim of this workshop is
to discuss and compare different methods for robust activity
recognition, as well as putting forward the need for common
resources for such comparison. To promote such comparison,
the workshop will present the outcome of a machine learning
challenge where contributed methods will be evaluated on a
public benchmark database of daily activities recorded using
a multimodal network of on-body sensors.
