## Abstract
This paper proposes a generalized algorithm that enables mobile agents to meet in a bounded region based only on bearing information of other agents within their vicinity. Each agent repeatedly employs a stop-and-go strategy consisting of the following three actions: (1) Estimate the bearing of agents in its vicinity, (2) compute a target point based on the estimates, and (3) move to that target point. The motivation and case study example is a modular robot, the Distributed Flight Array, which we employ to validate the proposed algorithm.
