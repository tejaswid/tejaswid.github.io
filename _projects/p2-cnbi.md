This project was as a summer research internship at the Center for Neuroprosthetics and Institute of Bioengineering (CNBI), EPFL, under the supervision of [Prof. José del R. Millán](https://people.epfl.ch/jose.millan?lang=en), [Dr. Ricardo Chavarriaga](https://people.epfl.ch/ricardo.chavarriaga) and [Dr. Hesam Sagha](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=ODZ_OwIAAAAJ&hl=en). In this project I evaluated several different machine learning techniques for classifying human activity. Data required for this analysis was recorded using a full body suit with accelerometers and gyroscopes with several subjects performing everyday tasks. This project was part of the [Opportunity Project](http://www.opportunity-project.eu/).
