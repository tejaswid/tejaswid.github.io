Mentored a team of three undergraduate students to construct a "Zero-contact" Robot Bar for the launch of the alcohol-free beer, Heineken Zer0.0 in July 2020.
This was a collaboration between Heineken, Momentum Worldwide and The University of Sydney. 
The bar featured two robotic arms, named Heidi and Ken, which served Heineken Zer0.0 alcohol-free beer to customers for four days.
The concept for the bar was designed keeping in mind physical distancing and zero person-to-person contact for preventing the spread of Covid-19.

A customer approaching the bar would be detected by a camera system which would trigger a conveyor belt to move a bottle of beer to a designated spot.
The robot arms were then programmed to pick the bottle from this location and hand it to the customer.
