Led a team of 6 students in the IROS 2020 Open Cloud Robot Table Organization Challenge ([OCRTOC](http://www.ocrtoc.org/#/)) in Aug-Nov, 2020.
Given a list of objects and their target poses, the goal of the challenge was to detect these objects on a table and use a robotic arm to pick up and place each object at its corresponding target, autonomously.

It was a novel experience to participate in a robotics competition conducted entirely in the cloud, with even us team mates working remotely.
Our team Sydney Siders qualified for the final round (real robot stage) of the competition having cleared the simulation stage.
