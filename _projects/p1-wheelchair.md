This project was my bachelor's thesis at IIT Jodhpur, supervised by [Dr. Swagat Kumar](https://sites.google.com/site/swagatkumar/). We developed alternate input modalities for a smart wheelchair platform to be used by people with severe motor disablilities who are unable to control a wheelchair using their hands/fingers as in the traditional way. My part of the project was in developing a control framework based on voice commands, while my colleague, Abhash Kumar Singh, worked on a control framework based on the motion and tilt of the person's head. This work was [published](../../publication/2013-07-04-Smart-Wheelchair) at the Advances in Robotics conference in 2013 and won the best paper award.
