This project was my Bachelor's Thesis. We developed alternate input modalities for a smart wheelchair platform to be used by people with severe motor disablilities who are unable to control a wheelchair using their hands/fingers as in the traditional way. My part of the project was in developing a control framework based on voice commands, while my colleague, Abhash Kumar Singh, worked on a control framework based on head motion and tilt. This work was published at the Advances in Robotics conference in 2013 and won the best paper award.
