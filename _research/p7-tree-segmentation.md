In this project we developed a data-driven algorithm for segmenting the 3D point cloud of a tree into two main components, branches and leaves, by using geometric features computed directly on the point cloud. 

A journal [letter](../../publication/2018-06-21-Automatic-Segmentation-Trees) on this was published in the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RAL), 2018 and presented at IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2018.
