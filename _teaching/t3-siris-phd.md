Internal course ([link](https://robotics.sydney.edu.au/foundations-of-robotic-research/)) for PhD students at the Sydney Insitute for Robotics and Intelligent Systems coordinated by Dr. Guodong Shi, Dr. Naoko Abe, Dr. Yi Sun and myself.

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to basic knowledge and tools in the broad areas of robotics, and how these tools are pooled together to deliver robotic solutions to crucial real-world problems. It also provides an overview of the fundamental challenges and opportunities at the frontiers of robotic research.

I delivered lectures on the module covering Deep Learning for Robotics.

From 2021, this course will be a formal unit of study at The University of Sydney with the course number MTRX8700.
