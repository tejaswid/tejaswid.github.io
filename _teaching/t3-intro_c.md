Course titled MTRX1702: Introduction to Robotics, coordinated by Dr. Viorela Ila at The University of Sydney. Lectured by Dr. Viorela Ila, Dr. Lachlan Toohey and Dr. Mehala Balamurali and myself.

This is a first year undergraduate course at the University of Sydney on C programming.

I delivered lectures on the modules covering Pointers, Ayyays, Strings and Bitwise operators in C programming.
I was also involved in designing assignments, quizzes and the final exam.
