Course titled [MTRX1702: Mechatronics 1](https://www.sydney.edu.au/units/MTRX1702), coordinated by Prof. David Rye and Dr. Viorela Ila at The University of Sydney. Lectured by Dr. Lachlan Toohey and Dr. Mehala Balamurali.

This is a first year undergraduate course at the University of Sydney on C programming.

I delivered lectures on the modules covering Bitwise operators, Input-Output in C and the limits of C.
I was also involved in assessing the final exam for the course.
