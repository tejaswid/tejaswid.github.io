Course titled [MTRX5700: Experimental Robotics](https://www.sydney.edu.au/units/MTRX5700), coordinated by Dr. Viorela Ila at The University of Sydney.

This is a final year undergraduate and graduate level course at the University of Sydney covering topics such as sensing, mapping, navigation and control of mobile robots and kinematics and control of industrial robots. The subject consists of a series of lectures on robot fundamentals and case studies on practical robot systems.

I delivered a lecture Deep Learning for Robotics as part of this course.
I am involved in designing assignments, setting up labs, assessing projects and exams along with tutors Jing (Johnny) Cheng and Stephany Berio Perez.
