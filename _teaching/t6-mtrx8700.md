Course titled [MTRX8700: Experimental Robotics](https://www.sydney.edu.au/units/MTRX8700), coordinated by Dr. Guodong Shi at The University of Sydney.

This is a PhD level course at the University of Sydney covering foundational topics in robotics such as sensing, imaging, control, mapping, navigation, learning and planning.

I was a co-coordinator for the course along with Dr. Yi Sun in 2021 and helped develop the curriculum for the course.
I handled the module on Deep learning for Robotics.
